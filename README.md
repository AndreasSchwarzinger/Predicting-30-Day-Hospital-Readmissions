Diabetes Hospital Readmission Analysis üè•üìä
A comprehensive clinical analytics project examining demographic predictors of hospital readmission among diabetic patients using machine learning and statistical analysis.
üìã Project Overview
This project analyzes hospital readmission patterns in diabetic patients using data from 130 US hospitals (1999-2008). The goal is to identify demographic risk factors that predict readmission within 30 days, enabling healthcare providers to implement targeted interventions and improve patient outcomes.
Key Research Question
Which demographic factors best predict hospital readmission risk in diabetic patients?
üéØ Objectives

Explore demographic patterns in hospital readmissions
Build predictive models to identify high-risk patients
Provide actionable insights for clinical decision-making
Support evidence-based discharge planning protocols

üîç Key Visualizations
Graph Outputs Explained:

Readmission Distribution (Pie Chart)

Shows overall readmission rates in the population
Helps understand baseline risk


Gender-Based Readmission (Bar Chart)

Compares readmission rates between males and females
Identifies gender-specific risk patterns


Age-Stratified Readmission (Stacked Bars)

Shows readmission patterns across age groups
Reveals age-related risk escalation


Correlation Matrix (Heatmap)

Numbers range from -1 to +1
Values closer to ¬±1 indicate stronger relationships
Blue = positive correlation, Red = negative correlation


Confusion Matrix (Heatmap)

Shows model prediction accuracy
Critical for understanding missed high-risk patients


ROC Curve

AUC score indicates overall model performance
Values: 0.5 (random) to 1.0 (perfect)


Feature Importance (Bar Chart)

Shows which demographic factors most strongly predict readmission
Positive coefficients = increased risk, Negative = decreased risk

üéØ Clinical Applications
Immediate Use Cases

Risk Stratification: Identify high-risk patients at discharge
Resource Allocation: Target interventions to vulnerable populations
Quality Improvement: Reduce preventable readmissions
Care Coordination: Enhanced follow-up for high-risk demographics

Implementation Recommendations

Integrate demographic risk scores into discharge planning
Develop culturally appropriate care pathways
Implement targeted follow-up protocols
Monitor outcomes by demographic subgroups

‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations & Considerations
Model Limitations

Demographics alone capture limited variance in readmission risk
Historical data (1999-2008) may not reflect current healthcare landscape
Missing important clinical variables (comorbidities, medications, social determinants)
Potential bias in historical healthcare data

Clinical Considerations

Model should supplement, not replace, clinical judgment
Requires validation in current healthcare settings
Consider ethical implications of demographic-based risk stratification
Regular model retraining needed as healthcare evolves
